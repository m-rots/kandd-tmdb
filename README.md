## Introduction

As part of my Knowledge & Data university project, I had to create a utility which grabbed the IMDb IDs from the `imdb.ttl` file and linked them to their TMDb equivalents.

This utility is written in Golang for its effortless networking capabilities and great parallelisation support.

To run this utility you will need:

- An `imdb.ttl` file generated by the [IMDb parser](https://github.com/m-rots/kandd-imdb).
- A [TMDb API Read Access Token (v4)](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api#v4_auth_key). Make sure you are logged into a [TMDb account](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup) before clicking the link!
- Patience as well as a good, stable internet connection.

### What happens under-the-hood?

1. All the IMDb Title IDs (`tconst`) are extracted from the `imdb.ttl` file.
2. Five workers simultaneously fetch extra information from the TMDb API for every IMDb Title ID (this step takes about 15 minutes).
3. All the extra information is appended to the `tmdb.ttl` file, which consists of both the IMDb Title ID, as well as all the added properties for every film present in the `imdb.ttl` file.

### Properties

The following properties are fetched from the `/find/{external_id}` endpoint:

- `id`
- `poster_path`
- `original_language`

## Running the CLI

I bet you have been waiting to run this puppy for years! Before I let you loose, make sure you have prepared your system:

1. [Install Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Copy the `imdb.ttl` file and place it next to the `README.md` file.
4. Build the binary by running this command: `go build -o tmdb`.
5. Run the binary and place your TMDb API Read Access Token as the first argument: `./tmdb "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.ey..."`.

Now wait for someone to start complaining about their Netflix not working!

If everything went well, you should see the `tmdb.ttl` file next to the `README.md` file.
